## What should I know before starting?

SplashBuddy goal is to provide an *elegant* and *secure* onboarding process for Mac users using [DEP](https://www.apple.com/business/dep/).

By *elegant* we mean:

- Adhering to the [macOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH4-SW1)
- Adhering to most of the [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#performance), when relevant (eg. the Performance section)

By *secure* we mean:

- Sandboxed
- [Developer ID](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/) [Signed](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) application
- Adhering to [macOS Human Interface Guidelines Security](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/Security.html)

[App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) is a good additional resource.

♻️Note: The very fact that this app exists violates one of Apple guidelines for good app design: [Think twice before providing an onboarding experience](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/StartStop.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH5-SW1)

### Contributing to code

Please create a pick a topic in the issues section:
